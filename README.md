# nevermind-metadata

> üêã Aquarius provides an off-chain database store for metadata about data assets.
> It's part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) software stack.

Note: Aquarius was formerly known as the Provider.

___"Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces. Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier. Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the Sun's apparent path)."___

**üê≤ü¶ë THERE BE DRAGONS AND SQUIDS. This is in alpha state and you can expect running into problems. If you run into them, please open up [a new issue](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius/issues). ü¶ëüê≤**

## For Aquarius Operators

If you're developing a marketplace, you'll want to run Aquarius and several other components locally, and the easiest way to do that is to use Barge. See the instructions in [the Barge repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge).

## For Aquarius API Users

The Ocean Protocol docs site has [documentation about the Aquarius API](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/aquarius/). Note that it shows the docs for the version currently deployed with the Nile Testnet. To get documentation for other versions, there is a "past versions" link at the top of the page.

If you have Aquarius running locally, you can find API documentation at
[http://localhost:5000/api/v1/docs](http://localhost:5000/api/v1/docs) or maybe
[http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/docs](http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/docs).

Tip 1: If that doesn't work, then try `https`.

Tip 2: If your browser shows the Swagger header across the top but says "Failed to load spec." then we found that, in Chrome, if we went to `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` and toggled it to Enabled, then relaunched Chrome, it worked.

If you want to know more about the ontology of the metadata, you can find all the information in
[OEP-8](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/8).

## For Aquarius Developers

### General Ocean Dev Docs

For information about Ocean's Python code style and related "meta" developer docs, see [the oceanprotocol/dev-ocean repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean).

### Running Locally, for Dev and Test

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/aquarius.git
cd aquarius/
```

Then run mongodb database that is a requirement for Aquarius. MongoDB can be installed directly using instructions from [official documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Or if you have `docker` installed, you can run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Note that it runs MongoDB but the Aquarius can also work with BigchainDB or Elasticsearch. If you want to run ElasticSearch or BigchainDB, update the file `config.ini` and run the Database engine with your preferred method.

Then install Aquarius's OS-level requirements:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3.7-dev libssl-dev
```

(Note: At the time of writing, `python3-dev` was for Python 3.6. `python3.7-dev` is needed if you want to test against Python 3.7 locally. BigchainDB needs `libssl-dev`.)

Before installing Aquarius's Python package requirements, you should create and activate a virtualenv (or equivalent).

The most simple way to start is:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=aquarius/run.py
export CONFIG_FILE=config.ini
flask run
```

That will use HTTP (i.e. not SSL/TLS).

The proper way to run the Flask application is using an application server such as Gunicorn. This allow you to run using SSL/TLS.
You can generate some certificates for testing by doing:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
```

and when it asks for the Common Name (CN), answer `localhost`

Then edit the config file `config.ini` so that:

```yaml
aquarius.url = http://localhost:5000
```

Then execute this command:

```bash
gunicorn --certfile cert.pem --keyfile key.pem -b 0.0.0.0:5000 -w 1 aquarius.run:app
```

### Configuration

You can pass the configuration using the CONFIG_FILE environment variable (recommended) or locating your configuration in config.ini file.

In the configuration there are now two sections:

- oceandb: Contains different values to connect with oceandb. You can find more information about how to use OceanDB [here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandb-driver-interface).
- resources: In this section we are showing the url in which the aquarius is going to be deployed.

```yaml
[resources]
aquarius.url = http://localhost:5000
```

### Testing

Automatic tests are set up via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

### New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps bump the project version. You can execute the script using `{major|minor|patch}` as first argument, to bump the version accordingly.
